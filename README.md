 ### Introduction ###
we developed CTDP (Identification of Cell Types associated with Disease Phenotypes), a novel framework based on Lasso-regularized logistic regression, augmented with permutation testing and false discovery rate correction. CTDP is designed to robustly identify phenotype-associated cell clusters from high-dimensional single-cell data.
